Welcome to tenv, and thank you for your interest in contributing during Hacktoberfest! We're excited to have you here and appreciate your enthusiasm for open source.
About tenv:
tenv is a versatile version manager for OpenTofu, Terraform, Terragrunt, Terramate, and Atmos, written in Go. We're committed to making infrastructure-as-code tools easier to manage across different versions and projects.

Getting Started:
Before diving into contributions, please take a moment to:

Read our CONTRIBUTING.md guide
Review our existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates
Join our community on Slack (OpenTofu workspace, #tofuutils channel)
Familiarize yourself with the project structure and documentation

What Makes a Quality Contribution:
We value meaningful contributions that improve the project. Here's what we're looking for:

Good Contributions Include:
Bug fixes with clear explanations and test cases
Documentation improvements that clarify existing features
New features that align with project goals (please discuss in an issue first)
Performance optimizations with benchmarks
Test coverage improvements
Fixing typos or grammatical errors in substantial documentation

Please Avoid:
Minor whitespace changes without other improvements
Trivial reformatting that doesn't improve readability
Automated bulk changes without manual review
Adding dependencies without discussion
Breaking changes without prior approval

Contribution Guidelines
Before You Start:

Check existing issues for something you'd like to work on

For new features, open an issue to discuss your idea first
Fork the repository and create a new branch from main

While Working:

Write clear, concise commit messages following conventional commit format
Keep commits focused on a single change or related changes
Add or update tests as needed
Update documentation to reflect your changes
Run the test suite to ensure nothing breaks

When Submitting:

Create a pull request with a descriptive title and detailed description
Reference any related issues using keywords like "fixes" or "closes"
Be responsive to feedback and questions from reviewers
Keep your branch up to date with the main branch

Areas Where We Need Help

Documentation: Help us improve setup guides, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips
Testing: Add test coverage for existing features or edge cases
Bug Fixes: Check our issue tracker for bugs that need attention
Platform Support: Help test and improve support across different operating systems

Install dependencies
Run tests to verify your setup
Review the project structure and existing code patterns

Communication
We encourage you to:

Ask questions if anything is unclear
Share your ideas and approach before investing significant time
Be patient while waiting for review (maintainers are often volunteers)
Engage respectfully with other contributors and maintainers

Code of Conduct:
We expect all contributors to treat each other with respect and professionalism. This project aims to provide a welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of experience level, background, or identity.
Quality Over Quantity
Remember that Hacktoberfest is about learning and making meaningful contributions to open source projects. We'd rather have one thoughtful, well-tested contribution than multiple rushed or superficial ones. Take your time, do it right, and learn something new in the process.
